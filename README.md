# industrial_safetty_monitoring

In the rapidly evolving industrial landscape, safety remains a paramount concern. 
Industries such as manufacturing, chemical processing, and energy production operate in 
environments where hazardous conditions can arise unexpectedly, posing significant risks 
to both personnel and equipment. Traditional safety measures, while effective to an 
extent, often rely on manual monitoring and periodic inspections, which may not be 
sufficient to detect and respond to threats in real-time. The need for continuous, 
automated safety monitoring has become increasingly critical in order to prevent 
accidents, mitigate risks, and ensure a secure working environment. 
* To address this challenge, the development of a “Flutter-Based Industrial Safety 
Monitoring System” has been undertaken. This system harnesses the power of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technology to create a comprehensive safety 
monitoring solution that operates seamlessly and efficiently in industrial settings. At the 
heart of this system is the NodeMCU microcontroller, a versatile and powerful device 
that serves as the central hub for data collection and transmission. 
* The NodeMCU is integrated with a suite of sensors specifically chosen for their ability to 
detect various environmental hazards commonly encountered in industrial environments. 
These sensors include: 
* Fire Sensor: Capable of detecting the presence of flames or significant increases in 
temperature, providing an early warning of fire outbreaks. 
* Smoke Sensor: Essential for identifying the presence of smoke, which is often a 
precursor to fire or combustion-related incidents. 
* MQ4 Sensor: A gas sensor that is particularly sensitive to methane (CH4) and other 
natural gases, making it crucial for detecting leaks in industries dealing with flammable 
gases. 
* MQ135 Sensor: A broad-spectrum air quality sensor that detects harmful gases such as 
ammonia, benzene, and carbon dioxide, which can indicate deteriorating air quality and 
the presence of hazardous substances.
